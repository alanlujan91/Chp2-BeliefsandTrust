                      HEALTH AND RETIREMENT STUDY (WAVE I)
                          General Coding Instructions
                      ____________________________________


        1.      Field Staff Editors have used red pencil to indicate
                changes/updates/revised data for you to code.  Coding
                Section Editors have used green pencil (with purple for our
                Check Editors).  Brown pencil is used by Regional Field
                Supervisors who check Iws.  If you have a question about
                any of the editing, feel free to ask the Supervisors.


        2.      Before you begin coding, read the Thumbnail Sketch.


        3.      As you code, read all marginal notes!  If no one is
                immediately available to answer a question, do not ignore
                the problem.  Indicate what you code in blue pencil beside
                the item and flag the page with a small "yellow sticky"
                (post-it-note).  If your decision requires a MAKE CARD, fill
                it out, but leave it in the interview at the flagged page.
                Put these interviews on the Coding Supervisor's desk or in a
                "problem box" if one is provided.


        4.      CODEBOOK JARGON

                DK:     (Respondent answers) Don't Know
                NA:     Not Ascertained
                Inap:   Inappropriate (item or question)
                NFS:    Not further specified
                NEC:    Not elsewhere classified


        5.      MONTH/YEAR CODING:

                a.      If MONTH is NA, but season is given, code:

                        Winter = 02     Spring = 05
                        Summer = 08     Fall = 11


                b.      All YEARs will be coded as 4 digits.


        6.      For all Q's asking "# OF YEARS", code "01" will include one
                year or less but will not include "NONE".
       Page CODING-002


        7.      RESTRICTED "AMOUNT CODES":  Whenever the full range of
                numbers is not available for an item (example V5, Length of
                Iw: the current valid range is 15-240 minutes only), make a
                card for any amount falling outside the valid range, and
                enter the actual amount given.  If you have an answer
                larger than the field width, code the highest actual number
                you can (usually X989) and make a card.

                Never assume the highest valid # includes "or more" unless
                it is printed in the codebook at the particular location.

                We will expand the machine range to include actual
                responses.  Be sure to give the card to the Coding
                Supervisor, not just put it in a stack on your desk or the
                Card box, as we want to get these changes made as promptly
                as possible.


        8.      PERCENT VS. %:  Answers requiring the R to respond with a
                percentage will be coded in one of two ways:

                a.      3-digit % field:  we will code a 3 digit whole
                        percent (001-100).

                b.      5-digit % field:  we will code a 3 digit whole
                        percent field plus 2 decimal places (xxx.xx).  In
                        these cases (usually asking interest rates being
                        charged on loans), an answer of 10-3/4% will be
                        coded 01075.

                c.      Conversion of fractional percentages into 2 decimal
                        places:

                        1/4 = .25       1/8 = .13
                        1/2 = .50       3/8 = .37
                        3/4 = .75       5/8 = .63
                                        7/8 = .87
       Page CODING-003


        9.      DOLLAR FIELDS:  Most $ fields are coded as 4-7 digit fields.
                Please be especially careful of the large fields--it's very
                easy to miss-key in a value and the error may be very
                substantial.  We have included "WARN" checks on 7 digit (or
                larger) fields.

                RANGE OF VALID CODES FOR DOLLAR FIELDS:  Please note that,
                due to the use of a "Range Card" for DK answers to $ fields,
                the code values are as follows:

                (000)0001-(999)9979.
                (999)9979.              $(999)9979 or more -- This is the
                                        code to use when an actual amount is
                                        given by R which exceeds our field
                                        width.

                ANSWERS GIVEN FROM "RANGE CARD":

                (999)9980.      A.  LESS THAN $500
                (999)9981.      B.  $500-$1,000
                (999)9982.      C.  $1,001-$2,500
                (999)9983.      D.  $2,501-$10,000
                (999)9984.      E.  $10,001-$50,000
                (999)9985.      F.  $50,001-$250,000
                (999)9986.      G.  $250,001-$1 MILLION
                (999)9987.      H.  $1 MILLION-$10 MILLION
                (999)9988.      I.  $10 MILLION-$100 MILLION
                (999)9989.      J.  MORE THAN $100 MILLION

                (999)9996.      NONE; NO USUAL/REGULAR/TYPICAL PAYMENT
                                (available at some locations); R only gives
                                assessed (home) value

                (999)9997.      OTHER/NEGATIVE AMOUNT; LOSS; amount in parens
                                (available at some locations)
                                [NOTE: MAKE CARD FOR ALL NEGATIVE AMOUNTS]

                (999)9998.      DK
                (999)9999.      NA

                In addition, there will be warning messages on several
                fields when large amounts are entered to try to clear out
                miss-punches as they occur.

                ALSO NOTE:  Many numbers are indicated by interviewers as
                "10 ---> 25".  This is an arrow to show a change of answer,
                not a range.  This indication of a change should be coded as
                the indicated figure only (in this example, code 25).
       Page CODING-004


        10.     "PER" Codes:  Time periods for periodic dollar amounts.
                Note that not all codes are valid at every location.  Use
                "7" and make a card if the code you need is not available.

                        1.      Hour (only available for wage/salary
                                questions)
                        2.      Week
                        3.      Every 2 weeks; twice a month
                        4.      Month
                        5.      Quarter; every 3 months
                        6.      Year

                        7.      Other [NOTE: MAKE CARD]

                        8.      Lump sum; one-time payment

                        9.      NA (incl. when amount is DK)


        11.     Tab items/pages in your codebook as you choose, but do not
                remove pages--get a xerox if you want copies of codes to
                keep outside of the codebook.


        12.     CONFIDENTIALITY:  Every coder (and indeed all staff members)
                are expected to respect the privacy and confidentiality of
                each respondent.  You should also remove any identifying
                information (such as the name of R, R's relative, the
                company R works for, etc.) from the Iw with black felt
                tip pen.  Please continue to respect R's privacy both at ISR
                and outside the office.


        13.     ROUNDING RULE:  If a range is given, code the midpoint of
                the range.  If the midpoint is .5 (and decimals are not
                appropriate to the field being coded), round to the nearest
                whole ODD number.  Therefore, an answer of "15-20" with
                midpoint 17.5 is coded 17.

                EXCEPTION:  Always round fractional ages down.

        TO:     HRS Coding Staff
        FROM:   Joan and Bruce
        DATE:   20 October 1992
        RE:     News notes, requests and instructions


        1.      Coding of true open-end questions (e.g., H54a):
                Please do not "double code" categories, including "other."
                E.g., if H54a responses are "paint thinner and benzene,"
                code 01,00 -- not 01,01.  If there are only two responses
                and neither fit the current code, put both responses on a
                card and code 97,00.

        2.      Please don't convert figures unless necessary to fit the
                code framework.  We've seen many instances of conversions
                from monthly to yearly amounts, i.e, when it wasn't
                necessary; check the "PER" code first.

        3.      If you are coding I'ws for checking, please do not go back
                into the case a second time or back up in a current case;
                doing so creates multiple printouts.

                If you discover that you have entered the wrong case ID,
                PF4 out and leave the case as an incomplete check case.

        4.      Be conservative with the use of NA codes; we've seen NA used
                in cases where information could have been "rescued," or
                assigned by a Supervisor.

                Also, take care to note the distinction between DK and NA;
                use DK when I'wer records it, and for answers such as "not
                sure," "can't answer that," "don't remember," etc.

        5.      For [IF MARRIED] locations:  If blank, do not code NA unless
                you know the question should have been asked.  If blank,
                code 0 (if not correct, you will get an error message).

        6.      If you are coding I'ws for check coding, you do not need to
                make cards.

        7.      In general, there's a need to consult codebooks more often.
                Check coding has turned up many cases where folks have
                missed instructions and/or code additions.

        8.      Problems with specific questions:

                Facesheet -- to avoid differences in check coding, code 0 in
                Var 24 (select R1 or R2) for all module types except A.

                B29f -- too many "accident" responses are being coded in 07
                when there is no clear indication of muscle involvement.
                "Hurt my back at work" could be 07, 08 or some other kind of
                back problem.
