                      HEALTH AND RETIREMENT STUDY (WAVE I)
                          General Editing Instructions
                      ____________________________________


        RECORDING

        1.a.    Editors must always write in the Interviews in GREEN PENCIL
                ONLY.

          b.    Check Editors must use PURPLE pencil.

          c.    Editing Supervisors must use PURPLE pencil only and must
                INITIAL all decisions they make in the Interview.

          d.    INITIAL EVERY IW you work on in the upper right corner (in
                green or purple as appropriate).


        DELETING ITEMS

        2.      NEVER ERASE AN INTERVIEWER'S ENTRY.  The Interview's entries
                must always remain readable even if it is considered deleted
                and to be ignored by the coder.

                Instead of erasing:

          a.    Edit the information which is to replace the Interviewer's
                entry into the Interview (at a place where it will be easily
                noticed and found by the coder if it is a codeable
                response).

          b.    Underline it. Whenever an item is underlined in GREEN or
                PURPLE pencil in the Interview it indicates that it is the
                correct information and other competing information should
                be ignored.

          c.    If an entire line is to be deleted (e.g., in Family
                Booklet), write "OUT" and an arrow to indicate the
                information that is being deleted.

                (NOTE:  Editor marks made in error may/should be erased to
                keep Iw as clear of confusion as possible.)


        MOVING ITEMS

        3.      Whenever it is necessary to MOVE information from one place
                in the interview to another, you should first bracket (in
                green) the information to be moved and then:

          a.    If it is to be moved on the same or a facing page: draw an
                arrow from the old location to the new.
       Page EDIT-002


          b.    If a larger segment to be moved or to move beyond a facing
                page: bracket ({) in green the items to be moved then place
                a note next to it clearly stating where it is to be moved to
                (i.e. "TO Q. H36a on P. 112").  Place a note also at the new
                location stating where it was moved from (i.e. "FROM M8").


        CONFIRMING

        4.      If the instructions specify that you are to edit an item,
                and there is already an appropriate and valid response to
                the item in place, underline the response to confirm it.


        MARGINAL NOTES

        5.      READ ALL MARGINAL NOTES which pertain, or may pertain, to
                any of the Items or Sections you are instructed to edit.
                Utilize all the information in these notes (as well as the
                Thumbnail Sketch which you will be instructed to edit) as
                you edit the Interview.  Thus, if a marginal note in the
                Housing Section informs you that R rents out the upstairs of
                their home, you should remember this in the Income Section
                if R says they receive no income from Rent (What you can do
                about it however depends entirely on the note and the other
                circumstances of the Interview).  When you use marginal note
                information at a different location annotate:  "See note,
                P.xx."


        CONFIRM NOTES

        6.      After you have read any marginal note; make a green
                checkmark next to it to indicate to the coder that it has
                already been read and dealt with. The coders will be
                instructed not to read notes with green check marks next to
                them.

                If you have already marked a note in other ways (i.e. by
                underlining parts or all of it, moving it, etc.), then you
                need not checkmark it also.


        EXPLANATORY NOTES

        7.      Explanatory notes should also be made (in addition to those
                above) whenever a decision is made which might not be
                apparent to someone reviewing the interview.  THE REASON FOR
                YOUR EDITING SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE CLEAR.  These would
                include things like consulting decisions with senior staff
                when initials of decision makers should be included.

        MISSING RESPONSES

        8.      Missing responses in the Interview are judged to be either
                NA (Not Ascertained) or INAP (Inappropriate).

          a.    NA

                A missing response is NA whenever:

                1)      A question was skipped which should have been asked.

                2)      R refused to answer a question (and there is no
                        pre-printed category for "refused").

                3)      An editor makes changes in an Interview so that
                        Questions which had not been asked are now
                        appropriate but missing.

          b.    INAP

                1)      A missing response is INAP whenever an Interviewer
                        is directed to skip the question by instruction in
                        the Iw.

                2)      An editor makes changes in an Interview such that
                        Questions which had been asked are no longer
                        appropriate.

          c.    MARKING FOR CODERS

                To mark NA or INAP items for coders:

                1)      INAP items skipped due to Contingency Instructions
                        should not be marked at all, but the "skip
                        instruction" should be underlined if this is a
                        new/edited skip.

                2)      If only one or two items are to be marked simply
                        enter "NA" or "INAP" in the response blanks.  If
                        there are already responses in the blanks, enter
                        "NA" or "INAP" next or near to these responses and
                        underline.

                3)      If more than a couple of items are involved
                        resulting in whole pages or parts of pages being
                        "NA"ed or "INAP"ed;

                        a) If a part of a page is involved print "NA" or
                           "INAP" in the margin of the first item with a
                           bracket to indicate length of the skip.
       Page EDIT-004


                        b)  If a whole page (or more) is to be marked, print
                            the "NA" or "INAP" in the outside top corner
                            margin with a "down" arrow under it. The "down"
                            arrows do not have to extend to the bottom of
                            the page.


        CHANGING SKIP INSTRUCTIONS

        9.      If while editing you must change a response box, draw an
                arrow from the old answer box to the new one, check the new
                box.  If there is a related (new) Skip Instruction, underline
                it.


        RANGES & ROUNDING

        10.     If a range is given, edit it to its midpoint, rounding when
                necessary to the nearest whole number.  If the midpoint is
                halfway between two whole numbers, edit it to the ODD
                number.


        DOLLARS & CENTS

        11.     If dollars and cents are entered in amount fields OTHER
                THAN HOURLY WAGES, edit the response to the nearest whole
                DOLLAR.  Round to the nearest ODD dollar if 50 cents is
                reported.

                * However, if you are using such an amount for calculations,
                  use the cents, but discard cents in the resulting total
                  figure.


        QUALIFIED AMOUNTS

        12.     Do not make adjustments to qualified amounts (such as "a
                little more than", "over", etc.).  Therefore, "over $1000"
                and "under $1000" will both be coded as 1000.


        CONVERTING TIME PERIODS

        13.     In a number of cases (B45b, B46b, B48, B49a) responses may
                be given in different time periods and the editor is to
                convert them to one selected time period.
       Page EDIT-005


                In order not to build a statistical abnormality into the
                resulting variable it is necessary to weigh each time period
                with the weight needed to put it onto the same unit scale as
                the other time periods.  Thus to scale all responses to "the
                number of days or nights in a year" you would:

                        MULTIPLY # weeks by 7

                        MULTIPLY # months by 30.4

                If you should encounter other written-in time periods try to
                pick the weight that will scale them to within 1 day of a
                365 day year.


        DOUBLE COUNTING

        14.     Editors should be continually on the lookout for instances
                where the respondent has reported the same information
                twice.  In most cases only a marginal note will alert you to
                these situations.  If the note is clear then you will need
                to edit accordingly.  In all cases where a marginal note
                leaves significant doubt about whether or not an amount is
                double-counted, see your Editing Supervisor.

                In some cases, you will suspect double-counting only because
                the same amount occurs in two different places.  If the
                number is a simple round number (such as $2,000), you will
                only be able to suspect, but do nothing.  If, however, the
                number is precise (say, $2,212, or better yet, $2,212.48),
                you may have clear evidence for double-counting.  If you
                have any such evidence, see the Editing Supervisor.


        SPLITTING AMOUNTS

        15.     If it is necessary to split dollar amounts in order to move,
                or delete, only a part of a debt, income or asset, use all
                available evidence and common sense to decide on the
                proportions.  If no evidence at all is available, you should
                split the amount(s) in equal parts.  IN ALL UNCLEAR CASES,
                you must seek the help and advice of the Editing Supervisor
                or have the Editing Supervisor review the procedure you use.

        "PARTNERS"

        16.a.   For the purposes of this study, a "Partner" is assumed to
                play the same financial role as does a "Spouse" and, for
                this reason, "Partners" are handled in the Interview exactly
                the same as "Spouses."  If you should find evidence that an
                Interviewer did not treat someone who should have been
                considered a "Partner" the same as a "Spouse".  See Editing
                Supervisor.

           b.   If a particular "Partner" might be better considered
                (because of indications that they do not share their income/
                assets) a "Friend" or "Roommate", bring the problem to the
                attention of the Editing Supervisor.



        FINANCES

        17.     Except where specified in the interview, financial questions
                are asked concerning only R1 (and R2 if there is an R2).  If
                you find evidence that the finances (income, assets, debts,
                payments, etc.) of anyone besides R1 and/or R2 have been
                included in a reported amount, that proportion not R1's and/
                or R2's will have to be edited out.


        CONFIDENTIALITY

        18.a.   At all levels of the survey research process we must
                preserve and confirm the trust of our respondents that the
                information they have given us will be treated respectfully
                and privately.  We are pledged to do nothing to expose an
                R's identity.  This includes while you are at work or
                outside of the workplace.  All persons who work with these
                data are bound by this code of behavior, or may be subject
                to dismissal.

           b.   In addition, if you should find specific confidential
                information such as names, names of businesses, etc. in the
                Interview (except on the Coversheet or the Family Booklet
                Stubs stapled to the Coversheet) you should:

                1)      Blot it out thoroughly with a black pen.

                2)      Attach a note to it (in green pencil), replacing the
                        information blotted out, in an unidentifying way.
                        Thus if "[R's daughter name]" is written in the
                        Interview, blot it out and write "R's daughter" next
                        to it.  If "[name of R2's employer who sells
                        hamburgers]" is written in the Interview; blot it
                        out and rewrite "The restaurant where R2 works".
       Page EDIT-007


        GIFT/INHERITANCE

        19.     At several places in the Interview (D21 for example), when
                the value of an asset is asked, a "GIFT/INHERITANCE" box is
                included.  Whenever you encounter one of these and marginal
                notes or information (there or elsewhere in the Interview)
                says that the asset, or part of the asset, was a gift or
                inheritance, you should:

        a.      Make sure the box is checked.

        b.      If notes indicate that the value given for the asset was not
                value at time of receipt by R, see Supervisor.


        "MINIMUM WAGE"

        20.     Reference list for Minimum Wage assignments

                If R answers "minimum wage", use table below to convert to
                hourly rate.

        DEFINITIONS

        22.     HRS DEFINITIONS:

           a.   "AGE ELIGIBLE": anyone in the HU who was born in 1931-1941.

           b.   RESPONDENT (R): the person answering the questions in an
                interview; can be either the R1 or R2.

           c.   PRIMARY RESPONDENT/R1/Knowledgeable R/KR:  In this survey,
                HH's were selected by having an age-eligible (born 1931-
                1941) person.  If a selected age-eligible R had a spouse or
                partner (regardless of the age of the spouse/partner), then
                "R1" status was determined by asking which of the couple
                knew the most about the finances.  This person was
                designated the KR (KNOWLEDGEABLE R) or R1.
       Page EDIT-009


           d.   SECONDARY RESPONDENT (R2):  spouse or partner of the primary
                (knowledgeable) R (R1).

           e.   PROXY:  a "substitute" respondent (usually a spouse) allowed
                to answer the interview under special circumstances.

           f.   HOUSING UNIT (HU):

                1)  a one-family house or half of a two-family house, or
                2)  an apartment or flat in an apartment house or other
                    building, or
                3)  a trailer or mobile home (as long as it has cooking
                    facilities), or
                4)  living quarters in back of stores, over garages, etc.,
                    or
                5)  a rooming house.

           g.   HOUSEHOLD (HH):  all persons living in a selected Housing
                Unit.


                FOR OTHER USEFUL DEFINITIONS, SEE THE GLOSSARY AT THE END OF
                THE EDITING INSTRUCTIONS.


        FLAGS

        23.     When you need to ask for assistance and supervisors or
                senior staff are not immediately available, use "YELLOW
                STICKIES" (POST-IT NOTES) to flag areas/questions to be
                investigated further.


        WORD TO THE WISE

        24.     Be conservative--have some evidence to make a change or
                leave it alone!!  This doesn't mean "proof", just something
                besides your hunch!


        25.     NEGATIVE $ AMOUNTS:  If negative amounts are recorded
                anywhere in the Iw, be sure they are clearly indicated as
                such.  Use parentheses [e.g., ($2,000)] to indicate a
                negative value.
       Page EDIT-010


        26.     (HAPPILY) MARRIED BUT LIVING SEPARATELY:  If you find
                notations indicating that a selected respondent and his/her
                spouse are married but live in two separate residences (not
                because they are having marital problems), edit the case as
                follows:

                1.  Edit A10 to '7' if the spouse is at another sampleable
                    address.

                2.  Edit A10 to '8' if the spouse is at a non-sampleable
                    address (e.g., jail, a nursing home, outside of the
                    U.S.) or if it is not clear where the spouse lives.

                3.  Treat the selected address as the main address in
                    Section D.  If they also own the home the spouse resides
                    in, count it as a second home.

                4.  List all the residents of both households as residents
                    of the sample address; do this as best as you can.

                5.  If any of the issues above are unclear, see Editing
                    Supervisor.


        27.     If R's reported income is specified to be "after taxes" or
                "take-home" pay, add 25% to the reported amount.

        FACESHEET

                INITIAL FACESHEET

                Place your initials in the upper-right corner of the
                facesheet of the Interview in green pencil to indicate you
                are the editor.



        PAIRS CHECK

                DO MARRIED PAIRS PROCEDURES

                1.  Compare the reported Marital Status of R1 and R2 which
                    is at Q. A10, page 3 of the interview.  If they do not
                    match, look for explanatory notes, and bring the Iw to
                    the Editing Supervisor.

                2.  Check the SAMPLE IDs, Item 2 on the Facesheet of the
                    interview.  The numbers should be the same except that
                    the last digit for R1 should be '1' and '2' for the
                    R2.  If this is not the case, see the Editing
                    Supervisor.

                3.  Check the Household IDs, Item 4 on the Facesheet of
                    the R1 and R2 interviews.  If they do not match, see
                    the Editing Supervisor.


        TEAR-OFFS

                CHECK THE STUBS STAPLED TO THE CS FOR CASE ID#S

                Find the xerox of the HU Listing from the coversheet.
                Stapled to it should be up to 4 buff-colored strips. Check
                each strip to make sure that the CASE ID # (found in the
                "For Office Use Only" box in the upper left corner of the
                Cover of the Interview) has been filled in.

                Fill in any missing CASE ID's.

        X19     READ THE THUMBNAIL SKETCH

                1.  Thoroughly read the thumbnail sketches from R1 AND R2
                    Iws (on page 217) to familiarize yourself with the
                    situation of the R1, the R2, and the household, and to
                    alert yourself to the following possible areas of
                    problems.

                       FAMILY COMPOSITION CHANGES

                       INCOME SITUATION

                        QUESTIONS

                2.  If this is a proxy respondent, write in the proxy's
                    relationship to the R (for whom the proxy is answering) on
                    the Facesheet of the interview below Item 12.  If Iw is a
                    "partial proxy," i.e., R answers for themselves part of
                    the Iw, but has a proxy for part, precode 2 on the CS at
                    item 12.

                        made by the interviewer regarding R's expressed
                        feelings about:

                        1.  the length of the interview

                        2.  the likelihood of a successful recontact at
                            Wave 2

                        3.  the spouse/partner receptiveness to the
                            interview.

                    b.  If comments are found in other parts of the Iw,
                        check with the Editing Supervisor before using them
                        for these precodes.

                    c.  Enter the codes in the upper right-hand corner of
                        page 127.

                1.  The HU reported on in this Section should be the HU
                    in which R is living at the time of the Interview.
                    Any other homes that R1/R2 may own, but are not
                    living in at the time of the Interview,  should be
                    reported in M2.

        D2a     FARM/RANCH HOUSE VALUE-DO NOT FORCE CONSISTENCY          21
                
                The question asks for the value of the "house and the
                immediately surrounding land" here. It is expected that
                the balance of the land will be reported in M6 if this
                farm/ranch is a working farm/ranch, or in M3 if this
                farm/ranch is not being actively farmed/ranched.

                DO NOT EDIT THIS QUESTION without specific marginal note
                information. We expect that we will find values reported
                here with no values reported in M3 or M6 for the
                remainder of the farm/ranch land. However, we cannot
                adjust the amounts unless R volunteers both the house
                and the farmland values and we know that they are missed
                in M3/M6.  If you get such specific information, see the
                Editing Supervisor.

                    below.

                2.  If either R1/R2 OWN or RENTS any part of the house
                    and lot/apartment, edit D17 accordingly.

                3.  Precode the response to "How is that?" under the Q.

                4.  If an R is changed to "neither owns nor rents",
                    check the "householder" column (I) of the FCW, and
                    code a '0' for all household members, since there is
                    no "householder" (i.e., no one's name is on the
                    lease or mortgage).

                5.  If there is no householder or no householder can be
                    identified, all persons living in the house should
                    be coded '0'.
      
                DEFINITION OF "NEITHER OWNS NOR RENTS"

                        Those who NEITHER OWN NOR RENT are those who:

                        a.  receive housing as part (or all) of their
                            pay.

                        b.  have sold the house in which they live, but
                            have not yet moved out and pay no rent.

                        c.  receive housing as a gift from someone
                            (besides the other R) who owns the house
                            (whether that owner lives in the HU or not).
       Page EDIT-020


                        d.  live in an HU which they believe they will
                            inherit in the future, but for which the
                            will has not yet been probated.

                        e.  have deeded the HU to someone (besides the
                            other R) such as a son or daughter, and are
                            still living in it rent free (often with the
                            understanding that they will be able to live
                            there until they die).

                        f.  do not pay rent with money, but with labor
                            and, therefore, receive their housing as
                            part of a job.

                        g.  have someone else pay ALL their rent, such
                            as:

                            1)  a Governmental Agency, like Welfare or
                                the Military.

                            However, if the agency pays the money to
                            R1/R2 and R1/R2 then pays the rent to the
                            landlord, R rents, and the money paid by
                            that agency must be included in N36a-c (if
                            Welfare) or N38g.

                            2)  a relative who is responsible for and
                                who pays the rent from their (the
                                relative's) own income.

                        In all of these above cases, R NEITHER OWNS, NOR
                        RENTS the HU and the information, if it is in
                        the OWNS or the RENTS section, should be moved
                        to the appropriate place.

                1.  If R1/R2 own only part of the home, the value
                    reported here should be only for that part they
                    own.

                2.  If R says they have been offered one amount, but

                    offered $80,000, but I wouldn't take less than
                    $100,000"), take the mid-point.

                3.  If R has been offered more than the actual value of
                    the property ("I've been offered $50,000, but it's
                    only worth $30,000"), take the amount offered.

                4.  If R mentions only the TAX assessed value of the
                    property, edit the value to the special code
                    "9--96".

                    170, to see if there is any "gift/inheritance"
                    listed there that could be home/apartment or which
                    may include it.

                    following priorities:

                    1st:  The closing date of the purchase.

                NOTE: The question asks for "...heat and electricity
                cost", but what is really wanted here, if given, is the
                cost of all electricity, gas and other means of heat,
                such as wood, coal and fuel oil.

                Edit as follows, with the above in mind.

                1.  Edit out any costs that marginal notes indicate
                    were not paid for by R1/R2.

                2.  If just a lump sum for 1991 is given, leave it, even
                    if notes indicate that some costs (such as gas for
                    cooking) were left out.
       Page EDIT-023


                3.  If marginal notes and itemized costs are given, and
                    nothing is entered in the blank, compute the total
                    cost from the notes and edit it in.

                4.  If marginal notes give known amounts that we want
                    included (such as cost of propane for cooking), but
                    that seem not to be have been included in the total
                    reported, edit them in.

                5.  If different averages for winter and summer are
                    given, assume that, in this case, "Winter" and
                    "Summer" are 6 months periods and calculate the
                    total.

                6.  Exclude, if possible, any amounts reported for
                    telephone, water, and sewer.

                7.  If R has moved and utility costs are given for the
                    current DU but not for 1991, use the information
                    given to determine the best guess of 1991 utility
                    costs for the current DU.

                    should never be edited out unless it is clear that
                    the Mortgage/Land Contract being reported is not on
                    the HU in which R is currently living.  Edit it out
                    if:

                    A.  it is on a HU that R1/R2 own, but are not
                        currently living in at the time of the Iw, such
                        as a second or vacation home. Move these
                        Mortgages/Land Contracts or Home Equity Loans
                        into D45a, if appropriate.

                    B.  it is on an HU that R1/R2 no longer own. Move
                        this debt to M20a.

                    C.  it is debt not owed by R1/R2; (i.e. it is held
                        by someone else, such as a relative or by a
                        business owned by R1/R2 or one of their
                        families).
       Page EDIT-024


                3.  If R1/R2 own the HU jointly with others, make sure
                    that the Mortgage/Land Contract or Home Equity Loan
                    is only for their share.

                4.  See the Glossary at the end of these instructions
                    for definitions concerning Mortgages/Land Contracts,
                    and Home Equity Loans.


        D33     EDIT THE AMOUNT OF RENT PAID FOR THE HU                  30

                1.  We want the rent most recently paid (or past due).
                    For example, if "we just paid $260, but next month
                    it's going to be raised to $275", edit the amount of
                    rent to $260 per month.

                    If R mentions several different amounts paid over
                    the past year, and gives an average, edit it to the
                    rent last paid (or past due).

                2.  If R1/R2 share the rent with others, edit the RENT
                    PAID as specified below:

                    A.  If the specific amounts paid are known, edit
                        RENT PAID to the amount paid by R1/R2 ONLY.

                    B.  If the specific amounts are not known, divide
                        the total amount of rent paid by the number of
                        people living in the HU and edit to one
                        proportion for R1 and another for R2, (if there
                        is an R2). If the situation is more complex than
                        this, check with the Editing Supervisor.

                3.  If R pays for both room and board:

                    A.  edit the amount of board out, if it is known.

                    B.  if the amount paid for board is not known;
                        assume half of what is paid in total is for
                        rent. If this seems unreasonable, see the
                        Editing Supervisor.

                          
        D34     IF RENTS FURNISHED OR UNFURNISHED                        30

                If marginal notes indicate that only stove and/or
                refrigerator are provided, edit D34 to "UNFURNISHED"
                if it is not already so marked.

        D39-D43

                If two or more timeshares are mentioned, use the one
                with the most value for state (D40) and year purchased
                (D41). Combine the number of weeks usage at D42b and the
                purchase prices and values at D43 and D44.  If two
                percents are given at D42a, calculate the percent R owns
                of the combined total value if possible.


        D39-D47 GUIDELINES TO EDITING SECOND HOMES

                DO NOT edit property out of D and into M unless there is
                rental income in N which appears to come from the
                property at D.  If it is not explicit that R's second
                home is investment and not a retirement home, leave
                information as R has reported it.

                Some respondents are reporting rental properties in the
                second home questions (D39-D47).  Some of these same
                properties are being reported again at M2-M3 as rental
                properties.  We would like these to be cleared up as
                much as possible in the editing process.  Here are some
                guidelines for doing the edits:

                1.  In general, if a second home is reported and there
                    is some indication that the R or his/her family is
                    currently using or intends to use the property, it
                    should be recorded in Section D, even if some rent
                    on the property is being received.

                    Conversely, property that is being exclusively used
                    for rental property and which R has no intention of
                    using for him/herself or family belongs in Section
                    M.

                    If a property is reported both places, it should be
                    left only in the most appropriate location (see note
                    2).
       Page EDIT-026


                2.  If property is mentioned at both D39-D47 and M2-M3,
                    and the property values are equal or very close,
                    (D44 minus D45a is the same as or very close to M3),
                    then check D46 and D47 to see if the R uses or
                    intends to use the home.  If so, then leave the home
                    in D39-D47 and delete it from M2-M3.  If the amounts
                    are the same or very close, and there is no
                    intention of present or future use of the home, then
                    delete it from D39-D47 and leave it in M2-M3,
                    assuming that it is more of an investment property
                    than a second home.

                      HEALTH AND RETIREMENT STUDY (WAVE I)
                          General Editing Instructions
                   SECTION E AND FAMILY COMPOSITION WORKSHEET
                   __________________________________________


        This part of editing the interview involves (1) establishing who was
        in the household at the time of the interview and (2) identifying
        the children, parents, and siblings of R1 and R2 that are relevant
        to the study's goals.  You will be assigning person numbers to
        relevant persons, entering data into the FAMILY COMPOSITION
        WORKSHEET screens, and printing the completed household listing.

        As you proceed through SECTION E, be alert to inconsistencies in or
        and confusion about who constitutes the family and the household.

        Interviewers were instructed to copy the CS listing, changing only
        the relationship to the Primary R.  These locations, therefore, list
        the HU members at the time of first contact.  It may not match the
        situation at the time of the interview.

        Should you encounter any information that leads you to believe
        that...

                a.  Someone who IS LISTED as a household resident in the X1
                    grid or the xeroxed CS listing WAS NOT LIVING in the HU
                    at the time of the Interview; OR

                b.  Someone who IS NOT LISTED as a household resident in
                    the X1 grid or the xeroxed CS listing WAS LIVING in the
                    HU at the time of the Interview; OR
       Page EDIT-028


                c.  There is some OTHER discrepancy between the information
                    at X1 and the information found in other parts of the
                    Interview relating to the HU situation at the time of
                    the Interview.

                     ...BRING THE INTERVIEW TO THE EDITING SUPERVISOR.


        DEFINITIONS FOR EDITING SECTION E

        Be aware of the following definitions and edit the X1 Listing,
        Section E and the Family Booklet in agreement with them.

        MARRIED         For purposes of this study a MARRIED couple
                        includes;

                        1.  those legally married,

                        2.  those living in a marriage-like relationship
                            with a PARTNER, either an opposite-sex or a
                            same-sex partner.

                        Length of time of the partnership is not taken into
                        consideration.


        PARENTS         PARENTS include only BIOLOGICAL AND ADOPTIVE
                        parents unless the question specifically asks about
                        STEP-PARENTS.

                        1.  When a question asks about STEP-PARENTS it is
                            concerned with step-parents married to a
                            biological and adoptive parent.  Otherwise any
                            reference to "parent" is a BIOLOGICAL OR
                            ADOPTIVE parent.

                        2.  If R has a living step-parent but not a living
                            biological/adoptive parent, R should be treated
                            as having NO living parent.

                        3.  Do not count as a parent other relatives who
                            have raised R.

        CHILDREN        CHILDREN, however, refers to BIOLOGICAL, ADOPTIVE
                        and STEP-CHILDREN.

                        1.  When a question refers to "Your child/any of
                            your children" it refers to any biological or
                            adopted child of R1 and/or R2. Thus a
                            "Step-child" would be included as long as that
                            child was a biological or legally adopted child
                            of either R1 or R2.
       Page EDIT-029


                        If you should encounter a "step-child" who is not a
                        biological or adopted child of either R1 or R2, you
                        should bring it to the attention of the Editing
                        Supervisor.  This would include a step-child of a
                        previous marriage where neither R1 nor R2 is the
                        parent.

        GRANDCHILDREN   "GRANDCHILDREN" may include great-grandchildren.

        SIBLINGS        "SIBLINGS" refers to BIOLOGICAL or ADOPTIVE SIBLINGS
                        and does not include STEP-SIBLINGS.  HALF-siblings,
                        being related by blood, are therefore included as
                        siblings.

        HU MEMBER       Any person who is living in the HU at the time of
                        the interview.

        ADOPTIVE        Related by legal adoption.


        BIOLOGICAL      Related by blood to one or two parents.  Includes
                        half-sisters and half-brothers (who have only one
                        parent in common), as well as "whole" siblings,
                        children, parents, etc. (who have two parents in
                        common).

        STEP-           Related by a current marriage or partnership.

        SIBLING         Biological or adoptive brother or sister of the R in
                        question.


        INSTRUCTIONS FOR FAMILY BOOKLET TEAR-OFFS

        1.      When names are left off of the tear-offs, or are not
                recorded in the Coversheet Listing, enter the reason they
                are not there using the following notations:

                        REF     The name was refused.

                        DK      The name was not known, or not remembered.

                        NA      The name was not legible, or not given, but
                                there is no indication of a refusal.

        2.      If 2-part first or last names are given on the tear-offs
                (e.g., "Mary Anne"), enter both parts onto the Family
                Composition Worksheets.

        __

        CS & X1 VERIFY THAT DATA TRANSFERRED FROM CS TO X1 IS CORRECT

                Check that the Interviewer correctly transferred the
                information from the Coversheet to the X1 HOUSEHOLD
                RESIDENTS grid on page 212 of the Interview.

                If there are inaccuracies in the X1 or CS listing, you will
                edit them to accurately reflect the situation at the time of
                the interview.   Any change that involves the leaving or
                arrival of HU members, MUST BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
                EDITING SUPERVISOR.  Remember that the date the CS was
                filled out and the date the Interview was taken may account
                for certain discrepancies.

                Note that the Iwer will have translated from
                "...Relationship to Informant" on the Coversheet listing to
                "Relationship to Primary Respondent" at X1. Check this very
                carefully.

                1.  If there are persons listed on the CS that are not
                    listed at X1, or vice versa, see the Editing Supervisor.
                    The persons listed on the CS and X1 should agree.

                2.  If any change to the X1 grid has been made--by a field
                    editor in red or by any other editor--be sure to
                    indicate this discrepancy on the FCW.

                3.  Check the accuracy of the ages for R1 and R2 at X1 and
                    on the CS listing using Birthdate which is recorded at
                    A1, Page 1, and the following table:
                                
                        IF R WAS BORN IN                    THEN R

                    given, take the calculated birthdate unless you have
                    reason to disbelieve it.

                3.  If there is other information, such as RELATIONSHIP or
                    AGE, that is different on the CS and X1, try to
                    determine which is correct as of the time of the
                    Interview and take it to the Editing Supervisor.  X1
                    will usually be correct, especially if the "informant"
                    was not a family member.


        X1      ASSIGN PERSON NUMBERS FOR R1 (AND R2) AND AT X1

                1.  Assign Person Numbers (PNs) for R1 and R2 (if there is
                    an R2) using the PERSON NUMBER CODE on page 62.  Print
                    the PNs in the left-most unlabelled column of the X1
                    "HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS" grid on p. 212.

                    NOTE THAT the Person Numbers assigned for R1 and R2 are
                    dependent on whether that R is age-eligible or not (see
                    codes 001-004).

                    NOTE:  PN codes D11-D19 and 021-029 ("FUTURE SPOUSES/
                    PARTNERS") should not be used for anyone in Wave 1.
                    They are reserved for NEW spouses/partners who will
                    appear in subsequent waves.

                    AGE ELIGIBLE Rs ARE THOSE BORN BETWEEN 1931-1941. (SEE
                    Q. A1, PAGE 1 OF THE IW.)

                1.  Verify the E1 Interviewer checkpoint and check against
                    X1 that the right contingency was taken. Note the
                    instructions to the interviewers regarding same-sex
                    partners.

                2.  In households where there is both an R1 and an R2,
                    establish whether R1 or R2 or Both gave Section E.
                    Designate who gave the information in each completed
                    Section E by writing "R1" or "R2" or "BOTH: R1" or "BOTH:
                    R2" at the top of page 35.

        E5-E6   1.  If this is a 2-Respondent household, designate at the
                    top of columns E5 and E6 which person is R1 and which
                    person is R2 by recording "R1" or "R2" in the
                    appropriate columns.  Column E5 asks about the
                    relationship of THIS R to each child.

                2.  CHECK that ONLY biological or adopted children of either
                    R1 or R2 are listed.  Use columns E5 and E6 to make this
                    determination.

                    IF PERSONS HAVING ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP (e.g., foster
                    children, grandchildren, etc.) are listed, edit them
                    out.

                    Edit them out of the E8 - E18 grid also if they are
                    listed there.  Write "OUT--not 18" to indicate they have
                    been edited out.

                3.  CHECK the HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS grid at X1 to see if any

                    there who were not listed in the E3-E6 grid of the FB.
                    ALL children listed in the X1 grid should be listed in
                    the E3-E6 grid unless:

                1.      Print the PNS to the left of the LINE#.  (It may
                        straddle the dotted line.)

                2.      Person Numbers must be unique within each household.
                        There can be no duplicates among the members of a
                        household.

               3.       The PNs of the children of R1 and R2 are assigned
                        based on whether they are the children of both R1
                        and R2, or of only R1 or of only R2.  If you need
                        further information regarding a child's relationship
                        to R1 or R2, see Columns E5 and E6 on page 1 of the
                        FAMILY BOOKLET.

                        temporarily away at school) should be assigned in
                        the order they appear in the Family Booklet.

                5.      For children listed in the E8 - E18 grid, copy their

                Check E19 in the Interview (p.35) or E18a (p.3) in the
                FAMILY BOOKLET.  If either of them is checked "YES" then
                there should be at least one entry in the "ADDITIONAL
                CHILDREN NOT LIVING AT HOME" grid on pages 3 - 4 of the
                booklet.

                1.      If there are no entries, check the TN and marginal
                        notes for information and bring the Interview to the
                        Editing Supervisor.

                If there are entries in the E20-E31 grid:

                1.      If this is a married couple household, designate at
                        the top of columns E22 and E23 which person is R1
                        and which person is R2 by recording "R1" or "R2" in
                        the appropriate columns. Column E22 asks about the
                        relationship of THIS R to each child.

                2.      Check the names of the "CHILDREN NOT LIVING AT HOME"
                        against the names of children living in the HU to
                        make sure that there are no duplications.  If there
                        are, remove one of the duplicates using any
                        available information (TN, marginal notes) and see
                        the Editing Supervisor.

                3.      CHECK that ONLY biological or adopted children of
                        either R1 or R2 are listed.  Use columns E22 and E23
                        to make this determination.

                        IF PERSONS HAVING ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP (e.g.
                        foster children, grand-children) are listed, edit
                        them out.

                4.      Assign person numbers to the ADDITIONAL CHILDREN NOT

                        PNs to children in the HU, pages 40-41 above.  See
                        columns E22 and E23 for information concerning
                        relationships to R1 and R2.  PRINT the PNs under the

                        listed, NA the items for one child in the grid.

                2.      Check that all children listed in the E36 - E39 grid
                        are also listed in the Family Booklet, either on
                        pages 1-2 or on pages 3-4.  If you find a
                        discrepancy, look for any relevant explanatory
                        information and see the Editing Supervisor.

                        NOTE:  Do not remove any of R1/R2's children from

                                paid for by R1 or R2 (e.g. "their grand-
                                parents paid for it").  If it is not known

                        number of siblings.  If the number of siblings
                        helping is more than one but less than all, it
                        should be coded 997.

                Record the PN's of all parents or step-parents who were
                helped. Separate "parents" into "mother" & "father" for the

                biological parents if there is not enough room to code all
                mentions.

                        be listed in the Family Booklet, pages 7-8.

                    a.  If E111 is 'YES' and no brothers or sisters are
                        listed, then enter NA across the first sibling entry
                        in the Family Booklet, pages 7-8.

                    b.  If E111 is 'NO' and there ARE siblings listed in the
                        Family Booklet, edit E111 to "1. YES".


        E112-   EDIT "HUSBAND/PARTNER'S LIVING BROTHERS AND SISTERS" GRID
        E123
                1.      CHECK E113 AND EDIT OUT from both grids any
                        "Brothers" or "Sisters" who are not biological or
                        adopted brothers or sisters, including step-siblings
                        and foster-siblings.

                2.      VERIFY E116 CHECKPOINT IN FAMILY BOOKLET:  COUNT the
                        number of brothers/sisters left in the "H/P'S LIVING
                        BROTHERS OR SISTERS" grid at E112-E115a in the
                        FAMILY BOOKLET AFTER THAT Grid HAS BEEN EDITED and
                        check that the CHECKPOINT at E116 is correct.  If it
                        is NOT, then edit it to be.

                3.      Check that Person #s and Line #s match the main grid
                        for the siblings recorded in the E118-E123 sub-grid.

                    a.  If siblings were selected for the E118-E123 sub-grid
                        who were edited out in a step above, EDIT IN A NEW
                        SIBLING to REPLACE the one edited out, USING THE
                        INSTRUCTIONS on the "SIBLING SELECTION LABEL".

                4.      Check the ages of the siblings to be sure they are
                        codeable.  If they are not, check for notes
                        indicating ages and edit in ages as best you can.
