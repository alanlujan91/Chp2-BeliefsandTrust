                        were helped.  If "parents" are mentioned, see
                        Editing Supervisor.  Do not separate "parents" into
                        "mother" & "father" for the financial help questions
                        (E124 & E125).

                5.      If money was reported as given only to a parent who
                        is now deceased, edit out that parent and amount of
                        money; edit E124 to "5. NO" if no other financial
                        help remains after editing E124a and E124b.


        E125b   RECORD THE PERSON NUMBER OF THE PERSON WHO HELPED R'S PARENT

                1.      If more than two persons total are mentioned, code
                        BIOLOGICAL parents and make a card for any "step-
                        parents" mentioned.

                2.      IF A NUMBER IS WRITTEN IN THE "# OF SIB" BLANK:

                    a.  Locate that "LINE #" in the Family Booklet, page 7,
                        of the sibling that corresponds to the Line # in the
                        "# OF SIB" blank at E125b.  ENTER this sibling's
                        "PERSON #" to the left of the "# OF SIB" blank and

                4.      Precode only the PN of one person who helped the
                        most OR one of the following:

                        996.  All helped equally (specified)

                        997.  Other combinations of helpers

                        Code 996 only if clear that all of R's siblings
                        (incl. R) helped, not just R and some of R's total
                        number of siblings.  If the number of siblings
                        helping is more than one but less than all, code
                        997.


        E126a   EDIT TO ONE PERSON HELPED PER LINE AND CHECK HOURS

                1.      If more than 2 persons total are mentioned, code
                        BIOLOGICAL parents and make a card for any "step-
                        parents" mentioned.

                2.      If the total number of hours spent (R1 and R2
                        combined for all people mentioned) adds up to less
                        than 100 hours, edit E126 to "NO".

                3.      Exclude any help given to parents who have died.

                Record the PN's of all parents or step-parents who were
                helped.  Separate "parents" into "mother" & "father" for the
                personal help questions (E126 & E127); give priority to the
                biological parents if there is not enough room to code all
                mentions.


        E127a   NOTE:  There is a type on the questionnaire at E127a.  The
                designation under the line should read "relation to h/p".
                Be alert for "mother-in-law" being written in to refer to
                "husband's/partner's mother"

                        parents" mentioned.

                2.      LOCATE the "LINE NUMBERS" in the Family Booklet,
                        page 7, of the sibling(s) that correspond to the
                        Line Number(s) written by the interviewer at E127b.
                        ENTER this sibling's "Person Number" to the left of
                        the "LINE #" blank and underline it.
       Page EDIT-047


                3.      Do this for each sibling listed and for each parent
                        listed.


        E127c   RECORD THE PERSON NUMBER OF THE PERSON WHO HELPED THE MOST

                1.      If a 'SIBLING' is indicated as the person who helped
                        the most, write that sibling's PN to the left of the
                        sibling box.

                2.      If the 'RESPONDENT' box is marked, record this
                        (Section E) R's PN in the box.

                3.      If the 'HUSBAND/PARTNER' box is marked, record the
                        husband/partner's PN in the box.


        E128a   CHECK COMPUTATIONS

                1.      CHECK computations (if components are given) at
                        E128a and make sure that total number reported is
                        for the past 12 months only.

                2.      Other religious and charitable organizations besides
                        those included in the gray shaded box labelled
                        "DEFINITION" include the Boy and Girl Scouts, the Y,
                        Community Organizations and any other not-for-profit
                        organization that R mentions.  If you find any
                        responses that you question, bring them to the
                        Editing Supervisor.

                3.      If the total number of hours adds to less than 100
                        hours, edit E128 to "NO".


        E134    VERIFY CHECKPOINT AGAINST X1 GRID

                If E134 is marked 1, verify marital/partner status against
                A10 and X1.


        X1      FINISH ASSIGNING PERSON NUMBERS TO REMAINING HU MEMBERS

                1.      Assign Person Numbers to all remaining HU members
                        using the person number code.  Record the PNs in the
                        left-most column of the X1 grid.

                2.      If not clear whether a relative is related to R1 or
                        R2, use the 'NA whom related to' number series
                        (801-899).
       Page EDIT-048


                3.      Using the completed HHL at X1, page 212, record all
                        HU members' Person Numbers onto the Coversheet HHL
                        in the right-hand side of Column A ("Household
                        member's full name").  Double-check these numbers
                        for all but the simplest and most straightforward of
                        households, since these numbers are crucial for
                        linking people to the information in the interview.


        FCW     ENTER ALL HU MEMBERS INTO THE FCW SCREEN 1
        HHL
                You will need the X1 Household Listing, the xeroxed CS
                Listing, page 1 of the R1 and R2 interviews, and the Family
                Booklet for this process.

                      THE FAMILY COMPOSITION WORKSHEETS

                Until such time as the "FCW Screens" program has been fully
                tested and is ready to use, you will be filling out paper
                and pencil "Family Composition Worksheets".  Later you will
                be entering the information into the Family Composition
                Database on screens that closely resemble the worksheets.

                The "PERSONS LIVING IN HU" grid of the FAMILY COMPOSITION
                WORKSHEET, when you have finished it, should list EXACTLY
                all those, and only those, who were living in the HU at the
                time of the Interview.

                ENTER INFORMATION FROM THE "HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS" GRID (X1)
                TO THE "PERSONS LIVING IN HU" GRID OF THE FAMILY COMPOSITION

                Work across each line from left to right (Cols. A-J) for
                each person listed in the X1 grid.  NOTE: Column J applies
                only to R1 and R2 if present.

                1.      Enter the PERSON NUMBER, RELATIONSHIP TO R text,
                        RELATIONSHIP CODE, SEX,  and AGE information from
                        the X1 grid into columns B-E of the PERSONS LIVING
                        IN HU grid of the FAMILY COMPOSITION WORKSHEET for
                        EACH PERSON listed.

                2.      Code Married Pairs in Column F (Marr Pair) of the
                        PERSONS LIVING IN HU grid of the FAMILY COMPOSITION
                        WORKSHEET.

                        MARRIED PAIR CODE

                            Pair listed in the HU (must always contain R1
                            and R2 if they are a married pair).  A couple
                            living together as a married pair (same or
                            opposite sex) also constitutes a married pair.

                        2.  This person is a member of the Second Married
                            Pair in the HU.

                        3.  This person is a member of the Third Married

                        9.  NA if this person is a part of a married pair,
                            or it is NA which married pair this person is a
                            member of.

                ENTER INFORMATION FROM THE CS TO THE FAMILY COMPOSITION
                WORKSHEET.

                1.      Enter the FIRST NAME and LAST NAME of each person
                        listed into Columns G and H of the FAMILY
                        COMPOSITION WORKSHEET using the information for that
                        person found on the CS.

                    a.  Type these names as accurately as possible as they
                        will be used on future panels.  If you have
                        questions concerning the spelling of a name, consult
                        the FAMILY BOOKLET stubs stapled to the CS and, if
                        necessary, see the Editing Supervisor.

                    b.  Be very careful that you match up the names with the
                        correct person on the FAMILY COMPOSITION WORKSHEET
                        screen.

                    c.  If you discover any discrepancies between the CS and
                        X1 at this point, be sure to take care of them or
                        take them to the Editing Supervisor.

                2.      CODE the HOUSEHOLDER CODE for each person in Column
                        I of the FAMILY COMPOSITION WORKSHEET using the
                        information from Column M of the CS and the code
                        below.

                        HOUSEHOLDER CODE

                        The "householder" is a person whose name appears on
                        the lease or mortgage for this housing unit.

                        0.  This person is NOT A HOUSEHOLDER; Column M of
                            the CS is not checked.
       Page EDIT-050


                        1.  This person IS A HOUSEHOLDER; Column M of the CS
                            is checked.  If you are able to determine from
                            the Iw who holds the lease or mortgage to the
                            HU, edit those persons to "1".

                        If no person is checked as being the Householder (no
                        line checked in Column M of the CS), see the Editing
                        Supervisor.

                        NOTE:  If R neither owns nor rents, then it is
                        likely there will not be a "householder."

                ENTER THE COMPLETE BIRTHDATE FOR R1 AND R2 ONLY FROM A1 ON
                PAGE 1 OF THE R1 AND R2 INTERVIEWS.

        FCW1    HH DISCREPANCY FLAG

                This 0/1 flag will be used to indicate whether or not there
                was a problem in the listing information given at the time
                of first contact (the CS listing) and the household
                composition at the time of the interview.  If a problem
                exists, this variable is coded '1', otherwise it is coded
                '0'.

                1.      There IS a discrepancy between the listing at first
                        contact and the Family Composition Worksheet.

                2.      There is NO discrepancy between the listing at first

                Enter up to 4 person numbers of the household members that
                create the discrepancy in Item #1 above.  These would be
                persons who are identified as being in the household at the
                time of the interview (hence they are on the FCW) but were
                not included in the listing at the time of contact.

                999.  Use this code for the first person to indicate that
                      persons listed on the CS Listing WERE NOT in the
                      household at the time of the interview.


        FCW 2   This field will be generated by the program and is a count
                of the number of household members in the HU at the time of
                the interview.


        FCW 3   SECTION E DESIGNATED RESPONDENT IS:

                This indicates for a couple-household which of the couple

        F2      At F2 there is a new code "2" meaning "works but not for
                pay." This will be used when a person works in his/her
                spouse's business, but receives no income.  Show Editing

                        given in weeks, edit to DAYS using the following
                        conventions:

                        1 WEEK  = 5 DAYS
                        1 MONTH = 22 DAYS

                F16e "OTHER (SPECIFY)" box and the response to F16k.

                1.      Edit out of F16a-n all Non-income or Non-cash
                        amounts such as:
                                 
                   A.   Reimbursements of expenses.  Edit out Mileage

       Page EDIT-054


                        RULES

                   A.   Do not edit an item into the "SALARIED",
                        "HOURLY" or "PIECEWORK/COMMISSION" section if it
                        will cause an NA amount.

                   B.   If two or more pay components are combined in a
                        "SALARIED", "HOURLY" or "PIECEWORK/COMMISSION"
                        section, and they cannot reasonably be split
                        apart, move the total amount to the "OTHER"
                        subsection.

                   C.   EXAMPLES:

                        1)  If "$15,000 PER year" is given at F16a with
                            a note reading "plus bonuses", edit
                            "bonuses" into F16k and move the amount of
                            the bonuses to F16m. If the amount of the
                            bonuses was not reported, edit NA into F16m.

                        2)  If "$24,000 PER year" was reported with a
                            note "including bonuses" you would edit
                            "Salary and Bonuses" to F16k and the total
                            amount to F16m.

                        3)  If "$15,000 PER year", is given and "plus
                            commissions" is written in, move the
                            "commissions" to F16h and the amount of
                            commissions into F16j. If the amount of
                            commissions was not specified, edit
                            "commissions" into F16k and an NA amount
                            into F16m.

                        4)  If "$25,000 PER year" "including
                            commissions" was given, you would edit
                            "Salary & Commissions" in F16k and "25,000"
                            into F16m (you would add it to F16m in the
                            unlikely event that an amount might already
                            be there).

                3.      Edit Salary, Hourly, Piecework and Commission
                        components out of the "OTHER" section (F16k,m)
                        into their appropriate "SALARIED", "HOURLY" or
                        "PIECEWORK/COMMISSION" sections, maintaining
                        RULE A at 2 above.

                    A.  EXAMPLES:

                        1)  If R reports "Salary and Commissions" at
                            F16k and "$36,000" at F16m, with nothing
                            else known; you would leave the response as
                            it is and where it is.
       Page EDIT-055


                        2)  If R reports "$30,000 Salary plus
                            Commissions" at F16k and reports "$36,000"
                            at F16m; you would move the whole response
                            out of F16k-n and edit "$30,000" PER "Year"
                            into F16a and "$6000" PER "Year" into F16h.

                            Note: If there was a response to F16n, you
                            would edit it into F16b & c. At other times
                            you may have to NA such items in the
                            SALARIED, HOURLY and PIECEWORK/COMMISSION
                            Sections if the information was not included
                            in items F16k-n.

                    B.  Tips and Bonuses should be left in the OTHER
                        Section.  All combined components that cannot be
                        split leaving only a Salary, Hourly, or
                        Piecework component should be left in the OTHER
                        Section.

                    C.  Some components of pay may actually be Salary,
                        Hourly, Piecework, or Commission components but
                        called something else.  If you are unsure take
                        it to the Editing Supervisor.

                1.      Edit F16 to reflect which types of pay R is paid
                        following the global editing above.

                2.      Precode the types of pay reported in F16a-n
                        following the global editing above, to the right
                        of the Q# "F16", using the TYPES OF PAY PRECODE
                        below.


        F16a    OVERTIME CODE

                If R reports getting "time and a half" on weekdays and
                "double time" on weekends, edit F16e to "X91."

                Use "X91" for any 'time and a half/double time'
                combination; if R reports "usually" time and a half or
                double time, edit to the usual rate.

                X90 -- R doesn't get paid for overtime -- not even a
                straight wage.


        F16k    PRECODE TYPES OF PAY REMAINING IN F16k, IF ANY           70

                Precode the types of pay left in F16k after the global
                editing above, in the right margin, outside the box,
                using the TYPES OF PAY PRECODE below.

                TYPES OF PAY PRECODE(1)

                If in question about whether R is truly salaried (e.g.,
                R is a nurse who checks "salaried" yet is paid by the
                hour), show Supervisor.  In most cases, R should remain
                in the "salaried" sequence, and type of pay should be
                converted to a per year amount.

                10.  SALARIED (ONLY)

                99.  NA

                (1)     This precode should be used when R has given
                        several rates and an "average" or "best
                        estimate" has been calculated.  For example, 3
                        rates are given for different shifts (take an
                        average), or both weekday and weekend rates are
                        given (assume 4 weekdays and 1 weekend day).
       Page EDIT-057


                (2)     If both the hourly rate and amount of tips are
                        known separately, precode 26 on p.69 and 72 on
                        p.70.  If tips are lumped in with the hourly
                        rate, divide the amount in half, coding 50% as
                        hourly wages (code 26 at F16) and 50% as tips
                        (code 72 at F16k).


        F23     CONVERT ALL ANSWERS TO "YEAR"                            72


        F33     CONVERT all "YRS AGO" and "AT AGE" responses to "YEAR"   74
                responses as per the instructions at F7.


        F32     If R is self-employed and checks "1" at F32 and clearly
                indicates that this is R's self, edit to 996.


        F39     If in question about the number and/or type of pension,
                e.g., Rchecks "3. Both A & B", and appears to give
                information for two plans, show Editing Supervisor.

                F86 is the same job reported in H, code "2" at F86, and
                "out" info at F86a-F89 to prevent double-counting.  If

                        problem-solving approach -- is only coded "1".

                        If the respondent gives multiple responses to an
                        item, score for the best response.  That is, if
                        any of the responses can be coded "2", code that
                        response.  If none of the responses can be coded
                        "2", then code the first response that can be
                        coded "1".  Finally, if all else fails, code
                        either "0", "7" or "9", whichever is
                        appropriate.

        M2-M20a GLOBALLY EDIT QUESTIONS OF NET WORTH OF R1/R2            164

                Go through these Questions carefully, checking notes and
                amounts, determining that Assets are reported in their
                proper place, that assets are not counted in more than
                one place (unless these instructions indicate that they
                should be), that conflicts are resolved, confusion
                clarified, and prepare this section is for coding.

                See change 12 for guidelines to editing second homes.

                The Primary Tasks to perform for each item are to:

                1.      CHECK DOLLAR AMOUNTS:

                    A.  Edit in Midpoints, and round to whole dollars,
                        etc., as per General Instructions.

                    B.  If the Interviewer noted computations;

                        1)  check the Interviewer's computations if the
                            total was entered,

                        2)  compute the total and enter it if it wasn't.

                2.      CHECK THE CONTINGENCY BLOCKS IF THE $ AMOUNT IS
                        CHECKED "REFUSED" OR "DON'T KNOW";

                    A.  If, after answering a dollar amount "Refused" or
                        "Don't Know" and while responding to the
                        questions following which ask whether the amount
                        would be as much or more than a certain amount,
                        R volunteers a specific amount; enter that
                        specified amount in the original dollar amount
                        blank and underline it for the coders.
       Page EDIT-070


                        EXAMPLE:  In answer to M3 R says "Don't Know".
                        Then, after the Interviewer asks M3a "Would that
                        amount to $50,000 or more" R says "yes, about
                        $100,000"; you should edit "$100,000" into the
                        blank at M3 and underline it.

                        EXAMPLE: In answer to M4 R "Refused".  After the
                        Interviewer asks M4a, "Would that amount to
                        $10,000 or more?", R answers "Nah".  The
                        Interviewer then asks M4c, "$2,000 or more?",
                        and R responds "no, just $100 or $200"; you
                        should edit $150 into M4 and underline it.
                
                3.      EDIT OUT ANY (PORTIONS OF) ASSETS NOT OWNED BY
                        R1/R2

                    A.  This would usually be known only if volunteered
                        by R and noted by the Interviewer. In these
                        cases, however, you should edit the value of the
                        asset, or whatever proportion of the value of
                        the asset is owned by someone other than R1/R2,
                        out of the Interview.

                4.      EDIT $ AMOUNTS TO "NET VALUES"

                    A.  Check the questions which ask for the "net"
                        value of assets by asking "if you sold all that
                        and paid off any debts on it, how much would you
                        get" and "what are they worth altogether, minus
                        anything you still owe on them" carefully for
                        notes indicating that R is not reporting "net"
                        value.  If you find any such indication you
                        should edit it appropriately.

                        1)  If R reports a $ amount, but then says "I
                            don't know how much is owed on it", edit the
                            response to "X98. DON'T KNOW" and "8. DON'T
                            KNOW" to the question following.

                        2)  If you find other notes indicating that R
                            did not report a "net" amount when one was
                            asked for and you are unsure of how to edit
                            the response, bring it to the Editing
                            Supervisor.

                5.      EDIT NEGATIVE $ AMOUNTS

                    A.  For the questions asking the "net" value of
                        assets it is possible that the value could be a
                        negative amount.
       Page EDIT-071


                        EXAMPLE: If R owned an asset that she could only
                        sell for $10,000, but owed $15,000 on, then the
                        value which should be reported for the question
                        would be a -$5,000.

                        Note that "I would get less than I paid for it"
                        does not necessarily result in a negative answer
                        to the question. If R paid $10,000 for the asset,
                        would get only $8,000 if he sold it now, but
                        only owed $5,000 on it; then the correct answer
                        he should give to the question is +$3,000.

                        However, if R says only "a loss" or "I would
                        lose money", in answer to the question, then you
                        should edit in a negative $ amount.

                        Edit in any negative $ amount by clearly placing
                        a dash in front of the number and underlining
                        it.  Edit in a negative NA/DK as indicated
                        below.

                        -999999 NA/DK Loss.     "I would get less than I
                                                owe on it".
                                  
                5.      DOUBLE COUNTING

                    A.  Always be on the alert for the same asset being
                        counted twice in the Interview when it is not
                        supposed to be.  It will usually be unclear when
                        this happens but, if you find a case and are
                        certain, bring it to the Editing Supervisor to
                        decide where to take it out.

                6.      READ EACH MARGINAL NOTE TO DETERMINE THAT THE
                        AMOUNTS REPORTED ARE REPORTED FOR THE
                        APPROPRIATE ITEM.

                    A.  At times the Interviewer may not have been sure
                        of where an asset reported by R should be
                        entered. They were instructed that it was more
                        important to enter it somewhere than not at all.
                        In each case the Interviewer will often make
                        note of these items. You should read each note
                        to assure that each such item is indeed entered
                        in the best place.  In order to do this;

                        1)  See the list below which notes which types
                            of assets should be included for each
                            Question;

                        2)  Use the Glossary at the end of these
                            Instructions for detailed definitions of the
                            various types of assets;
       Page EDIT-072


                        3)  Be very cautious in this task and take note
                            of the following;

                            a)  Do Not Move or Delete any amounts unless
                                the evidence for doing so is quite
                                clear.  It is far better to leave things
                                as they are than to move and edit in
                                error!

                If the Iwer has noted that the figures given at M3
                (other real estate value) and M6 (business value) are
                for the same business, i.e., are double-counted, check

                NOTES:

                DEFINITION:  A mobile home, house trailer or trailer
                home is fixed to its lot.  A motor home has a motor and
                is self-propelled. A travel trailer or camping trailer,
                for purposes of this study, is towed by a car and
                "parked" when not being towed.  It is not fixed to its
                lot.  If it becomes fixed to its lot it should be
                considered a mobile home.  Be aware, however, that Rs
                confuse these terms and may not be using our
                definitions.

                        PARTNERSHIPS (At M2 and Note 1 below)

                NOTES:

                The "Net" Value of Farms/Ranches and Businesses reported
                at M6-M6c should include the value of land, buildings,
                equipment, livestock, tools, vehicles and real estate
                owned by the business.  Thus, any mention elsewhere of
                assets being "owned by our business" should alert you to
                bring the Interview to the Editing Supervisor, as should
                values given at M6-M6c with a note reading "not
                counting ...".

                NOTES:

                1.      At F37 the Interviewers were instructed NOT to
                        include IRA's and KEOGH PLANS, BUT to make a
                        note in the margins (on pages 75-85). Check
                        there if you think you need to.

                2.      The amounts listed at G31g, G36a and H14g
                        "ROLLED OVER INTO IRA" are not counted there as
                        assets, so they should be listed here.  But an
                        IRA mentioned there may since have been cashed-
                        out or converted, so we cannot force consistency
                        here.  If you find one there (G31g, G36a, H14g)
                        that is not mentioned here (M77-M9), take it to
                        the Editing Supervisor.

                Do not include unpaid bills (like utility bills, rent,
                etc.) which are just bills that R hasn't paid yet,
                unless they have become so large and overdue that
                regular installment payments have been arranged or R
                doesn't expect to be able to pay them off for a number
                of months or years.  Do not worry about this unless

        M21-M28 INHERITANCES AND TRUSTS RECEIVED                         169

                        elsewhere in the Interview, if they are still
                        being held. Leave these double-counted, as this
                        section is dealing with the source of the asset
                        (not R's current net worth).

                2.      If more than one date is written in at M24,
                        indicating more than one inheritance or trust
                        was received from the same source, leave the
                        earliest and move the other(s) to the next
                        column(s).  If separate amounts are unknown,
                        split the total amount equally among the parts.

                3.      If you find a case where the amount of the trust
                        is DK, but R knows the amount of income
                        generated by the trust; take it to the Editing
                        Supervisor.

                4.      If no value is given at M25 but an income amount

                        Supervisor.

                        column(s).  If separate amounts are unknown,

        N2-N50  GLOBALLY EDIT QUESTIONS OF INCOME OF R1/R2

                Go through these questions carefully, checking marginal
                notes and dollar amounts, to determine that the various
                types of income are reported in their proper place, that
                income amounts are not double-counted and that conflicts
                are resolved, confusion clarified, and that this section
                is ready for coding.

                The Primary Tasks to perform for each item are to:

                1.      CHECK DOLLAR AMOUNTS:

                    A.  Edit to midpoints, round to whole dollars, etc.,
                        as per the General Instructions.

                    B.  If the Interview noted computations in the
                        margins;

                        1)  check the Interviewer's computations if the
                            total was entered, 

                        2)  compute the total and enter it if it wasn't.

                    C.  If a dollar amount is reported for both R and
                        Spouse but the question asks for the amount for
                        each separately:

                        1)  Split the amount equally between them,
                            unless Interviewer notes provide the
                            information necessary to split the amount
                            more accurately.

                2.      EDIT OUT ANY (PORTIONS OF) INCOME NOT PAID TO
                        R1/R2:

                        We are only interested in income paid to R1/R2.

                    A.  If income is reported which is paid to someone
                        in the HU besides R1/R2, edit it out.
       Page EDIT-080
                        1)  If an amount of income is reported which was
                            paid to R1/R2 and someone else (EXAMPLE: R2
                            and his cousin made $5000 painting a house
                            in their spare time), edit out a
                            proportional amount for the non-R part.

                    B.  If money is paid for R1/R2, but not to him/her
                        (EXAMPLE: Welfare pays the rent to R1/R2's
                        landlord), it is not R1/R2's income and should
                        be edited out.

                        1)  "Fringe" benefits, such as Health Insurance,
                            Pensions, Stock Options (when awarded,
                            before being exercised), etc., paid by an
                            employer, but not to R1/R2, should not be
                            included.

                3.      EDIT OUT NON 1991 INCOME:

                        This will happen infrequently and will be for
                        such things as income from another year being
                        paid R in 1991 (and noted as such) or R
                        reporting 1992 amounts, such as, "I'm making
                        $250 a week now, but I was only making $225 last
                        year", or "I'm making $27,000 now, I just got a
                        5% raise last week".Be alert to these when they
                        happen.

                4.      WATCH OUT FOR NET INCOME AMOUNTS:

                        Income amounts should be reported "Gross", that
                        is before taxes and deductions. If you find any
                        "net" amounts, take them to your Editing
                        Supervisor.

                    A.  Income from businesses, farms, professional
                        practices, or partnerships should be reported
                        less expenses (i.e. "profit"), but before taxes.

                5.      EDIT OUT NON-CASH INCOME:

                        Only "cash" income should be included.  In-kind
                        income (unless, like food stamps, it is
                        specifically asked for) should be edited out.
                        This includes; housing supplied with a job, a
                        company car, free groceries, etc.


                6.      EDIT OUT NON-INCOME AMOUNTS:
                                                                          
                        "Reimbursement" for expenses incurred is not
                        income.  Edit out travel expenses, expense
                        accounts (including on credit cards), housing
                        allowances, uniform allowances, etc.

        N2a-N2d INCOME FROM JOBS                                         173
        N5a-N5d
        N7a-N7d 1.      Do not move amounts between items N2a-N2d unless
                        the amounts are clearly specified and are easy
                        and clear to move. If, for instance, a note at
                        N2a says "including commissions" and the amount
                        of commissions is not specified; leave the
                        commissions in N2a.

                2.      It is important to watch for double-counting
                        between these items.  Watch particularly for
                        double-counting between:

                          N2a and N2b or N5a and N5b
                          N2a and N2d or N5a and N5d
                          N2c or N5c and N38a
                          N7a and N7b
                          N7a and N7d
                          N7c and N38a

                        However, do not edit out any amount unless it is
                        quite clear that they are double-counted.

                3.      If N2b/N5b is checked 'YES' but a note indicates
                        that bonus, overtime, etc. amount is included in
                        the wage/salary amount, edit N2b/N5b to 'NO'.



        N3a     WAGE OR SALARY INCOME                                    173
        N5a
        N7a     EXCLUDE (or MOVE): Income from privately held
                businesses, farms, professional practices or
                partnerships. This income should go in N38a.  However,
                some Rs who own a business may pay themselves a salary,
                which they may report here. The remaining income (profit
                less draw) would go in N38a. If there is any indication
                that the amount reported here as salary is not excluded
                from the profit reported in N38a (i.e. has been double-
                counted), see the Editing Supervisor.

                              

        N2c     INCOME FROM PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE AND TRADE              173
        N5c
        N7c     This category is meant to contain income of people who
                are in the trades (carpenters, plumbers, etc.) or
                professions (accountants, chiropractors, dentists,
                doctors, lawyers, etc.) who "practice" their trade or
                profession but who do not consider themselves to "have a
                business" in the sense of N38a. These may be self-
                employed (in which case the income here should be "net
                of all business expenses"), or they may work for someone
                else.

                IF INCOME IS REPORTED HERE:

                1.  Check N38a to see if there is also income reported
                    there, if there is;

                2.  determine if it is double-counted with the income
                    reported here, if it is;

                3.  Always take it out HERE.


        N10a    If benefits were awarded retroactively, edit the date R
        N12a    began receiving them to the retroactive date.
        N15a
        N17a
        N21
        N24
        N26d

        N18/N25 MILITARY RETIREMENT PENSION                              177
                                                                         178

                If R is receiving a military retirement pension (N18=
                YES), he/she may also respond 'YES' to N25 and report
                the pension again.  If so, edit N25 to 'NO' and retain
                only the information at N18-N21.


        N19/N22 Veteran's pensions should be counted only at N19-N21
                and/or N22-N24; they should not be double-counted at N26
                or N27.

                If both "1" and "3" are checked at N19 or N22, change
                code to "5.  Both 1 and 3 (new code).


        N25-    If R reports a pension settlement that was rolled over
        N27d    into an IRA, it should not be counted as 1991 income.


        N26/N27 If noted in margin or made otherwise clear, code 4 (new
                code) if R1 or R2 receives money from the pension of a
                previous spouse; code 5 (new code, combination of codes
                1 & 4) if R1 or R2 received money from R's own pension
                and that from a previous spouse.

        N28     SSI/SOCIAL SECURITY                                      179

                Some R's confuse SSI with Social Security.  If income is
                reported here (at N28-N31), check N43-N43b to be sure
                it's not mentioned again.  If it is, remove it from N43-
                N43b and leave it at N28-N31.


        N38a    BUSINESS/FARM/PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE/PARTNERSHIP INCOME   181

                All income reported in N39b should be reported NET OF
                ALL EXPENSES, (i.e. "profit").

                1.  These expenses may include a salary ("draw") that R
                    pays him/herself and his/her spouse (which should be
                    reported at N3/N5 or N7),

                2.  All salaries paid to anyone else who is paid by the
                    "business",

                3.  All other expenses or costs of doing business.


        N38c    DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST                                   181
                

                Include here all interest and dividends from stocks,
                bonds, savings accounts, etc., including interest from
                IRA's which is automatically "rolled-over" and
                reinvested with the IRA if it is given.
                              

        N40g    OTHER INCOME                                             182

                Check all the sources of OTHER income listed to
                determine if each should be moved to one of the types of
                income already asked, should be edited out as per rules
                above, or left here.

                See below for locations of various types of income.  The
                item number specified should be the dollar amount
                location.

                NOTES

                1.  Commodity Credit Loans and Soil Bank Payments are
                    part of Farm Income. If farm income at N39a is given
                    with a note that says "plus Commodity Credit Loans"
                    or "plus Soil Bank Payments" them you would add
                    these payments to Farm income.

                2.  Stock Options should be recorded at N39g only if it
                    can be determined that R1/R2 exercised a stock
                    option (that is, bought a designated stock at the
                    pre-set [low] price and sold it at market value and
                    made a profit).  What would go in N39g would be the
                    "profit" of exercising the stock option. They should
                    know this.  If no dollar amount is specified with
                    the mention of "stock option", edit it out.


        N48b    Leave lump-sum amounts from retirement at N48b.  Do not
                double-count them at N26 or N27.

                (FU members only)

                1.      Identify and compare each person listed in the
                        this N54 Other HU Members Income grid against
                        those listed on the FCWS and edit this grid to
                        agree with the FCWS, unless there is clear
                        information indicating that the FCWS should
                        be corrected.

                    A.  Note that ONLY those 15 years old and older, are
                        supposed to be listed here.  If there is a
                        discrepancy between the age of an HU member on
                        the FCWS and here, and you can not determine
                        which age is correct, use the age found on the
                        FCWS an correct it here.

                    B.  Edit out any persons listed here that are not on
                        the FCWS.

                    C.  Edit in any HU members found on the FCWS not
                        included here.  NA N55 and N56, unless that
                        information is found somewhere else.

                2.      Transfer the PN for each HU member listed, from
                        the FCWS to the "RELATIONSHIP TO R" column of
                        this grid (right under their relationship).

                        "religious" or "charitable", take it to the
                        Editing Supervisor.
