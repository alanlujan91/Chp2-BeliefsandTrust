        5101    L1.     Part of this study is concerned with people's
                        memory, and ability to think about things.  First,
                        how would you rate your ability to think quickly at
                        the present time?  Would you say it is excellent,
                        very good, good, fair, or poor?

        5102    L2.     Compared with 2 years ago, how would you rate your
                        ability to think quickly?  Would you say it is much
                        better now, somewhat better now, about the same,
                        somewhat worse, or much worse now than it was then?

                L4.     Next, I'll read a set of 20 words and ask you to
                        recall as many as you can.  We have purposely made
                        the list long so that it will be difficult for
                        anyone to recall all the words -- most people recall
                        just a few.

                        Please listen carefully as I read the set of words.
                        When I finish, I will ask you to recall aloud as
                        many of the words as you can, in any order.  Do you
                        have any questions?

                        and equally good job, with a 50-50 chance it will
                        double your (family) income and a 50-50 chance that
                        it will cut your (family) income by a third.  Would
