        9087    MG3.    We are interested in whether adult children have
                accurate information about their parents' health and
                finances.  There is a lot of scientific interest in
                questions of this sort.  Researchers don't know whether
                they can obtain reliable information about finances from
                people who are quite old and sometimes in poor health.
                   
                We have already asked you about the health of your
                (mother/father/parents), and now would like to ask a few
                questions about their finances.  With your permission, we
                would also like to ask your (mother/father/parents) the
                same questions, so that we can compare your answers to your
                parents' answers.
                   
                Would you be willing to answer these questions?

                whether you think you [or your (husband/wife/partner)] will
                need additional health insurance coverage, and what you
                think it might cost.

                        10 equals absolutely certain, what do you think are
                        the chances that you will need long-term care in a
                        nursing home at some point during your lifetime?

        _____


                Now I have a few questions about your preferences for
                spending and saving as you get older.  To make the questions
                comparable for all respondents in the survey, let's suppose
                that you are now 50 years old, that you [and your (husband/
                wife)] will retire when you are 65, and that you [and your
                (husband/wife)] will live to be 80.  Further suppose that
                future health care costs are fully covered by insurance,
                that there will be no inflation, and that your income after
                taxes is guaranteed to be $3000 each month from age 50
                to age 80.

                                                       
        9156    MK1.    [GIVE CARD I TO R.]  Card I contains several
                        possible patterns of monthly spending before
                        retirement, the striped bars, and after retirement,
                        the solid black bars. By saving part of your income
                        before retirement, you can have more to spend after
                        retirement, as in choice E.  Or you could borrow
                        and spend more before retirement, spending less
                        and repaying the loan after retirement, as in choice
                        A.  Or you could just spend your income each month,
                        as in choice C. Thus you can afford any of the
                        spending patterns shown on Card I.  Which pattern
                        do you like the most?

        9159    MK4.    [GIVE CARD IV TO R.]  Here is another card with 5
                        more spending patterns for before and after
                        retirement.  As before, by saving part of your
                        income before retirement, you can have more to
                        spend after retirement.  Assuming that you
                        can afford any of the spending patterns shown on
                        Card IV, which pattern do you like the most?
