This subrepository retreives data from the Household Retirement Survey (HRS) and the General Social Survey (GSS) so that it may be used in the empirical analysis of this work. This is **strictly** done in to make reproducibility of these results easier. An end user could just as easily go to the corresponding websites for the HRS and GSS and download the data themselves. In many cases, this is likely to be preferred.
